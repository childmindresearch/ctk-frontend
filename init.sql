Requires Confirmation: Full criteria are likely met based on our evaluation and history of impairment, though HBN is unable to confirm the diagnosis due to a limitation in our evaluation protocol.

Recommendation would be to treat anxiety/add learning support , then further evaluate for ADHD OR Insufficient information in the HBN evaluation to make a diagnosis (or to say that the child definitively does not have a diagnosis), but concerns or vulnerabilities were evident that should be further evaluated /monitored e.g., concerns from parent about writing in educational history and behavior obs that child struggles with all writing tasks; rule-out SLD, with impairment in written expression? 5.

However, clinical concern regarding personality development emerged in interviews, based on core patterns of mood instability, high-risk behaviors, substance use, unstable sense of self, suicidal ideation, and interpersonal conflict. Several traits that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences and manifests can be consistent with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The diagnosis is described in DSM-5 in the following way: ''A pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts.'' Information obtained during the current evaluation clinically identified the following symptoms of BPD: 1. A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation. 2. Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self. 3. Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats 4. Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days) 5. Chronic feelings of emptiness As five criteria are required by DSM-5, a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder is assigned below as a presumptive diagnosis requiring confirmation over the course of future therapeutic treatment with {{CHILD_NAME}}. Treatment for BPD is recommended below with the goal of treating {{CHILD_NAME}}''s adaptive coping skills in an intensive and comprehensive manner. Traits {{CHILD_NAME}}''s exposures to trauma are an important factor in sculpting his/her approach to attachment and formation of his/her personality. Of note, personality disorders are not formally assessed with the measures used in this evaluation. However, clinical judgment based upon qualitative factors gleaned from {{CHILD_NAME}}''s own descriptions of his/her thoughts, feelings, and behavior, and evaluator observation of same, raises concern for the possibility of a Personality Disorder, specifically Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The diagnosis is described in DSM-5 in the following way: A pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts. Observations during the current evaluation suggested the following symptoms of BPD: instability regarding self-image/affect and marked impulsivity across settings. A diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder does not appear in the list below, but clinical observation and judgment suggests that further consideration should be given by professionals working with {{CHILD_NAME}} to facilitate ongoing evaluation of and monitoring for a personality disorder.',17,'2024-03-19 20:11:55','2024-03-19 20:11:55');

As such, improvement in {{CHILD_NAME}}''s anxiety symptoms would be expected with effective treatment of ADHD and additional support in his/her classroom. Although {{CHILD_NAME}} does not currently meet criteria for a diagnosis of any specific anxiety disorder, considering these significant internalizing symptoms appear directly related to environmental stressors (i.e. academic difficulty, need for more support in classroom, teasing by peers), a DSM-5 diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder, with anxiety, is appropriate to account for his/her school refusal. It is strongly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} undergo psychotherapeutic treatment to address his/her emotional regulation skills, improve his/her self-esteem and teach him/her how to adaptively cope with frustration in school. Careful monitoring is recommended to determine if there is any change in symptom presentation or severity as social and academic demands increase.

Based on the current evaluation, these symptoms do not currently meet full criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder and can better be accounted for by generalized anxiety. However, it is important that these symptoms be monitored closely in treatment considering his increased vulnerability associated with history of rigidity and anxiety. {{PARENT_NAME}} also reports repetitive finger and toe-nail biting which can cause bleeding.

Individuals diagnosed with ADHD are at risk for increased difficulty with emotional and behavioral regulation, due to the frustration they experience in executing executive functioning skills. Impairments in executive functions likely directly impair his/her impulse control and ability to flexibly process information in a timely manner. Outbursts may serve as a child''s only means of communicating frustration or negative feelings.

His/Her oppositional behavior also did not meet threshold for diagnosis of a disruptive or conduct-related disorder. Nevertheless, individuals diagnosed with ADHD are at risk for increased difficulty with emotional and behavioral regulation, due to the frustration they experience in executing executive functioning skills. Improvements in emotional outbursts and oppositional behavior should be expected with effective treatment of ADHD (as described below). {{CHILD_NAME}} will require behavioral support to reinforce positive behaviors and provide are common in children who experience significant anxiety, when they have not developed coping skills for managing worry or frustration.

Emotional outbursts are common in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders. Children with autism spectrum disorders often lack an understanding of emotions and the adaptive skills necessary to cope with them, as well as the social communication skills to convey frustration and negative feelings. Furthermore, {{CHILD_NAME}}''s profound impairments in executive functioning likely directly impair his/her impulse control and his/her ability to flexibly process information in a timely manner.

In consideration of his/her other symptomology, past and current life-stressors, and school underachievement, we are concerned that without appropriate treatment, {{CHILD_NAME}}''s substance use will increase and cause substantial impairment in his/her functioning.

To meet full diagnostic criteria for a research-based diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, an individual must exhibit at least 6 symptoms of inattention and/or 6 symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity. {{PARENT_NAME}} has observed {{CHILD_NAME}}''s inattentive and hyperactive symptoms to be evident and impairing in various settings (i.e., home, school, community).
